What Should I Consider before Getting a New Haircut?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58789/what-should-i-consider-before-getting-a-new-haircut/,"Before getting a new haircut, you should consider which style would work best for the shape of your face and your hair texture. Another thing to consider is how much maintenance your new haircut will require. If your lifestyle is fairly active or busy, or if you are involved in sports, you might want a shorter style that requires minimal care and upkeep. You also need to consider how well your new haircut will fit with your profession. A trendy new haircut might not project a professional look, depending on your line of work. 

When changing your hairstyle, you’ll want to consider how it might suit your everyday tasks. If you work in a job where you must tie your hair back in a hairnet or under a cap, a mid-length hair length style might be impractical. Longer lengths for women are easier to tie back in a ponytail, making those haircuts more versatile. 

Choosing a haircut, whether you are male or female, can be made easier by consulting with an expert. This might mean making an appointment at your hair salon and getting some advice from a stylist. Your first consideration should be to choose a reputable and qualified hairstylist. She can advise you as to what styles and cuts will best complement your shape of face and your hair texture. She’ll also have magazines you can browse through for ideas.       

Before you choose your new hairstyle, consider how a particular cut will match your personality. Your new haircut should make a statement and reflect the individual you are. If you are lively, energetic, and outgoing, perhaps you would go for a daring and bold new hair style. If you’re quiet and reserved, however, a classic haircut may suit you better.

Also, consider the texture of your hair. If your hair is fine and thin, you might do well with a layered new haircut. This will add fullness, dimension, and volume to your fine hair and make it appear to have more body. If your hair is thick and unruly, avoid cutting your hair extremely short, or choosing a very long style. For coarse, wavy and very thick hair types, a medium length hairstyle might work best. 

One more consideration when you are contemplating a new haircut should be age. Regardless of which styles you admire on someone else, your age should play a factor in your decision when choosing a cut and style for yourself. Again, seek the expert advice of a hairstylist or beautician before making your final decision.", Beauty
What Are Scene Hair Extensions?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58785/what-are-scene-hair-extensions/,"Scene hair extensions are long pieces of synthetic or human hair dyed in brilliant colors, such as green, yellow, or hot pink. “Scene” is a general term that describes a subset of the emo culture, which is popular with young adults. A big part of dressing in the scene style is to have colorful hair. Many people do this by wearing 1-inch (about 2.5-cm) hair extension clips in different colors. The hair extensions can be pink, green, orange, neon, or any color combination. Emo hair is closely related to scene hair, but it is usually dyed black, flat-ironed, and not as voluminous or as colorful as scene hair. 

Teenage girls make up the majority of the consumer base for scene hair extensions. While this emo hairstyle can be worn by males and females, girls usually sport the look and wear the colorful extensions. Though the hairstyle is a subset of the emo culture, it is important to differentiate scene style and emo style, as a true emo hairstyle does not use colorful hair extensions, and the hair color is usually dyed a uniform black color.

Coontails, which are zebra-striped sections of hair, are also popular. Scene hair extensions that are black-and-bleached dyed are commonly seen as well, along with side-swept bangs that cover one of the eyes. The hair extensions are applied close to the scalp with snaps or crimps, which hold the hair in place for a day or longer.

Scene hair is cut so that the hair is a few inches (about 7 or 8 cm) long on top with longer layers underneath. There are usually numerous layers throughout the hair, with the shortest layer at the crown. This hair is teased up and held with hairspray for extra volume. The bigger and brighter the hair, the more “scene” it looks.  

Scene hair extensions are usually applied near the back of the ears so they blend in with the longest layer of hair. They are then trimmed to match the length of the hair. The coontail-style hair extensions usually are applied on each side of the head so they match.

Hair extensions can be made from human hair, often imported from Asian countries, or synthetic materials. Human hair strips are more expensive, but they blend in with the wearer’s natural hair better than synthetic extensions. Human hair can also be heat styled like regular scalp hair. Synthetic hair extensions are less expensive, but they cannot be flat-ironed or curled, as the intense heat can cause them to melt. These types of extensions are found online and in beauty supply stores.", Beauty
What Is Instant Eyeshadow?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58786/what-is-instant-eyeshadow/,"Instant eyeshadow is a type of eye makeup applied via an applique strip instead of a makeup brush. Some brands also refer to instant eyeshadow as press-on eyeshadow. With instant eyeshadow, individuals can apply all of the latest color trends and styles, along with unique prints and patterns, right at home. The eyeshadow is applied by placing the applique over the eyelid and then peeling it back off. After a little additional blending with a finger or a brush, a professional look is achieved in a matter of seconds.     

A major benefit of using instant eyeshadow is the fact that multiple colors can be added in one step, which makes this product great for achieving a smokey look around the eyes. This can save busy people a lot of time because they won’t have to get out a makeup palette and individually apply different colors to each part of the eye. It’s also an easy way to keep up with new makeup trends. Normally, each time a new trend emerges, new techniques must also be learned to achieve that look. With instant eyeshadow, it’s as simple as purchasing a new kit, with nothing new to learn whatsoever.      

Another benefit of instant eyeshadow is that it gives users the option of wearing styles and patterns that cannot be achieved with the application of regular eyeshadow. For example, instant eyeshadow appliques come in just about any color combinations, animal prints such as zebra or leopard, and patterns such as snowflakes or camouflage. They provide a simple method for applying professional eyeshadow looks at home without having to go to a cosmetic artist or paying a hefty fee. These eyeshadow kits come in many brands and can be purchased through local retailers that sell cosmetics, at malls, and online.   

When applying instant eyeshadow, the first step is to place the applique strip over the eyelid, with the color side against the skin. The applique should be smoothed using a finger and held in place for a few seconds. After the color has had a chance to set in, the applique should be gently peeled away by starting from the inner corner of the eye and working outward. The applique is then set aside and a more professional appearance is created by using a finger or a brush to gently blend the colors together. Some kits also contain an optional setting powder that can be applied to help keep the color in place throughout the day.", Beauty
What are the Different Types of Contact Lenses?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58787/what-are-the-different-types-of-contact-lenses/,"Many people turn to contact lenses when they grow tired of wearing glasses day after day.  Contacts fall into two basic groups: soft and rigid gas permeable.  The contacts that used to be called “hard” are very rarely prescribed anymore.  There are also a few popular specialized styles of contact lenses.

Soft contacts are made of a soft flexible plastic that is up to 80 percent water. They are usually the most comfortable lenses.  Their softness can be a disadvantage, though, when it comes to collecting grime with wear.  There are a couple of types of soft contacts.  Extended wear contacts can be worn overnight.  Disposable contacts are thrown away after a set number of days, giving the wearer a regular supply of fresh, clean contacts.

Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contacts are made of a slightly flexible plastic that may cause discomfort when they are first worn, but the eye quickly adapts.  They create sharper vision than soft contacts in some cases.  RGP contacts are also much more durable than soft variants, and thus more expensive per lens.  Extended wear contacts are also available in rigid gas permeable form, thereby allowing for overnight wear.

Toric lenses for astigmatism can be either soft or RGP; the name refers to the lens design.  They are created with special curvatures and will stay in place once in the eye for steady vision.  Other lenses can be used to correct astigmatism with careful fitting, but torics work best in the most severe cases.      

Bifocal lenses are available as both soft and RGP contacts.  They are designed much like bifocal glasses with one area of the contact for near vision and the other for seeing distances.  It requires an adjustment period, but the eye adapts to looking through the proper area.  If this style of lens doesn’t work out, it is also possible to put a different lens in each eye to simulate the bifocal effect.

Special effects or novelty contact lenses are used for non-prescription purposes and can also come in either soft or rigid gas permeable styles.  Whether you want to try a new eye color or look like a cat, it’s possible with these types of lenses.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Wall Hair Dryer?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58788/how-do-i-choose-the-best-wall-hair-dryer/,"In order to choose the best wall hair dryer, you should consider how much power you need the dryer to have, what you want it to look like, and what features you want it to have. As with all hair dryers, the power that a wall hair dryer has will determine how fast and efficiently it can dry hair. Since this type of hair dryer will be mounted on your wall and always be in view, you should give some thought to how it will look in your bathroom. Additional features are available on most wall hair dryers, and you should think about which features you like.

The power of a wall hair dryer is typically measured in watts. Most models produce somewhere between 1,200 and 1,600 watts, which might be less than other conventional types of hair dryer. When you are choosing a power level, think about how often you plan to use your hair dryer and how quickly you need for it to dry. Some dryers are also labeled as “ionic” or “turbo” which means that they include technology that might make them more efficient. Be sure to think about how many power and heat settings are on the wall hair dryer as they can affect how you are able to use the hair dryer.      

Conventional hair dryers often get stored away in a cabinet and are not always on display, but a wall hair dryer is, by nature, always visible in your bathroom. Most models are white, but there are other color options such as black, beige, or red that might look more pleasing in your particular bathroom or suit your taste better. Some models also include a built in night light, so if you would have otherwise used the covered up outlet for a night light, one of these hair dryers might work well for you.

One feature to think about when picking a wall hair dryer is how long the power cord is. You can only use this type of hair dryer in one specific location, so you want to make sure it has enough cord to be convenient no matter how you want to use it. This is especially important if you are installing it in a bathroom with a long counter where you might want to stand at either end. Additional features that might interest you include automatic shut off when the hair dryer is returned to the cradle and a removable lint trap to allow for easy cleaning of built up hair and dust.", Beauty
When Should I Throw out Old Cosmetics?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58784/when-should-i-throw-out-old-cosmetics/,"Cosmetics have a limited lifespan. Using cosmetics that are old can cause several problems. Older cosmetics may harbor bacteria that may lead to breakouts or even infections. The color in some cosmetics may change over time, and a foundation that used to work perfectly may become too dark. It is a false economy to hang onto cosmetics that are outdated. It is a better idea to purchase fewer products so that you have time to use them before they expire. 

When you buy new makeup, don’t think that you will be able to remember when you bought it. Instead, determine what the last date that you should use it will be, and write that date down on the package with a permanent marker. When that date arrives, even if the makeup still looks good, get rid of it. 

The recommendations listed below are just guidelines. Some all natural products will not last as long as other types of cosmetics. They do not contain preservatives that extend the life of the makeup. Also, even if something is practically new, if it smells or looks funny, throw it out.       

In general, powder products will last longer than cream formulations. Any cosmetics that are used around the eyes will not have as long of a shelf life as items used on the rest of the face. Finally, if you become sick, it makes sense to ditch your eye makeup after you recover. Along ith this talk about transferring bacteria, it goes without saying that sharing makeup is not something you should do. 

Items that last for up to two years include face powder, powder blush, powder bronzer, powder eye shadow, lipstick, lip liner, and pencil eyeliner. While pencil eyeliner should remain safe for up to two years, you can sharpen the pencil frequently so that a clean surface is exposed. If you believe that any of these items may be contaminated, you can wipe off the surface area with a tissue to expose a clean area. 

Cosmetics that should be replaced after one year include oil free foundation, cream foundation, compact powder, concealer, cream blush, lip gloss and nail polish. Replace liquid eyeliner and mascara every three months. Liquid eyeliner and mascara are easily contaminated, and should also be replaced if you develop conjunctivitis or other eye condition. 

Replacing old makeup is an easy way to keep your skin healthy and looking good. Many people suffer from clogged pores and breakouts due to contaminated makeup. Although most people realize that eye makeup needs to be replaced frequently, they often do not realize other makeup can become outdated as well.", Beauty
What Are the Different Types of Strengthening Shampoos?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58780/what-are-the-different-types-of-strengthening-shampoos/,"Strengthening shampoos are gentle cleansers designed to repair damaged and brittle hair. The main difference between strengthening shampoos is the way these products strengthen the hair. Some shampoos provide hair with an additional supply of keratin, which is a protein that makes up much of the hair strand. Many shampoos contain a variety of strengthening ingredients, like collagen, elastin and a variety of moisturizing agents. In addition to strengthening and protecting the hair, a few shampoos are also formulated to strengthen the follicles and prevent hair loss.

The majority of strengthening shampoos contain very gentle surfactants, which are the ingredients that cleanse the hair and scalp. These shampoos commonly lack sulfates, which are harsh detergents responsible for the lathering action associated with most shampoos. Over time, sulfates and other harsh surfactants can be very drying. Non-sulfate strengthening shampoos will not damage the hair or strip the strands of natural oils.

Different strengthening products will also contain a number of nourishing ingredients. One of the most common ingredients is keratin. When a person uses a keratin shampoo, the protein will coat and protect his or her individual hair strands. Each hair strand will be more able to withstand the damage caused by heat styling, pollution and other environmental factors. With regular use, keratin shampoos increase elasticity and result in healthy, strong hair.

Shampoos that contain keratin are especially helpful in strengthening curly hair, which is more likely to become dry, frizzy and unmanageable. The use of a keratin shampoo will rebuild hair strands and reduce frizz. Keratin builds a heavy layer on the hair strand, so such shampoos make it easier to straighten and style curly hair.

Aside from keratin, many products also contain elastin, collagen and several different moisturizing agents. Elastin is a protein that gives the hair much of its strength, flexibility, and elasticity. Collagen is another protein that contributes to the strength of the connective tissues. These proteins are capable of improving both the strength and appearance of the hair.  

Moisturizers, like coconut oil, shea butter and humectants, also work to revitalize dry, unhealthy hair. One of the leading causes of hair breakage is dryness. Most strengthening shampoos strengthen hair strands by providing much needed moisture.

Consumers hoping to achieve strong, healthy hair might also be able to prevent hair loss. Some strengthening shampoos contain ingredients like peppermint oil and menthyl lactate. These ingredients are believed to protect against hair loss due to their ability to block Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the hormone responsible for male pattern baldness as well as baldness in many women. While these ingredients are not included in every strengthening shampoo, formulas that also promise to thicken the hair often contain DHT inhibitors.", Beauty
What Are the Different Types of Casual Updos?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58781/what-are-the-different-types-of-casual-updos/,"Most any type of hairstyle with the hair swept up off the shoulders can be transformed into a casual updo. Even updos that are sometimes considered more formal can be made casual by loosening up the hair before it is pinned in place. Some of the most common casual updos include ponytails, braids, French twists, and buns. 

Of all the casual updos, ponytails may be the most popular. Hair is brushed up and held in place using a rubber band or ponytail holder. Ponytails can be worn on top on the head, but are more frequently worn at the back of the crown or the nape of the neck. Hair adornments such as bows or ribbons can be attached to the ponytail to coordinate with clothing or makeup. One of the drawbacks to wearing a ponytail is that if the hair is pulled too tightly, wearers sometimes develop headaches or soreness of the scalp.

Casual updos done with braids are also popular. The hair can be secured as for a ponytail, but instead of hanging loose, the ponytail is braided and secured at the end, where bows or other hair accessories can be attached. Another way to wear a braided updo is to braid the hair, then wrap the braid into a bun that is then secured with pins.      

The French twist updo can be both casual and elegant at the same time. This hairstyle is done by cinching the hair into a loose ponytail at the nape of the neck, then twisting it upward. The ends of the ponytail are tucked into the twist at the base of the crown. Casual updos such at the French twist can be secured with pins or combs. For those with longer hair, it is sometimes possible to do this hairstyle without securing hair at the base.

Buns can be done in a couple of different ways, depending on the length and thickness of the hair. For hair that is long and thin, it may not be necessary to secure the hair before beginning to wrap the bun. For thicker or shorter hair, it may be necessary to first secure the hair with a rubber band or ponytail holder. Once the hair is secured, or placement of the bun determined, hair should be wrapped in a circular motion, pinning the hair in place while wrapping. When the ends of the hair are reached, they are then tucked into the underside of the bun and pinned in place.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Sugar Exfoliator?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58782/how-do-i-choose-the-best-sugar-exfoliator/,"The best sugar exfoliator uses raw, organic sugar cane as a base ingredient, combined with natural oils and minerals.  This type of product is designed to rejuvenate skin by removing dirt and grime from the surface while improving the appearance of pores.  It also contains anti-inflammatory properties that make it an ideal treatment for mild skin rashes and irritations that leave red, itchy patches that cause discomfort.  Individuals who are sensitive to fragrance should avoid purchasing products that contain additional perfume and fragrance oils.  This product is easy to use, and can be lathered onto skin and scrubbed in vigorously during a bath or shower.

A sugar exfoliator uses glycolic acid, a naturally occurring chemical found in sugar cane, to scrub excess dirt and dead skin cells from the body.  It also naturally reduces the appearance of pores and improves skin’s elasticity — a quality which tends to fade with age.  The sugar used as the base in the exfoliator should be both organic and raw.  This type of cane produces a large exfoliating crystal that is non-abrasive and nourishing to the skin.  Smaller crystals can tear at and damage more sensitive skin, and occasionally causes allergic reactions if the scrubbing crystals begin to clog pores.      

A good sugar exfoliator will also contain additional moisturizing minerals and oils.  Ingredients, such as almond oil and jojoba oil, can soften skin following the scrubbing process, and prevent it from drying out.  Almond oil is recommended by some dermatologists to combat the inflammation and itching sensation associated with overly dry skin.  Jojoba oil will not evaporate from the surface of the skin like water based moisturizers, and creates a protective barrier that locks moisture into skin cells and promotes healing simultaneously.  Other common exfoliator additives include green tea extract, safflower oil, sunflower seed oil, and natural fruit extracts.

This type of product is generally recommended as a topical treatment designed to improve the appearance of skin and soothe irritated, dry patches that may have become damaged from a skin condition or overexposure to the sun.  Those individuals with allergies to fragrance may benefit from purchasing a sugar exfoliator that is free from dyes and perfumes.  Most product labels will include perfume in the list of ingredients to help consumers avoid purchasing items that can harm them.  The raw sugars, almond oils, and jojoba oils found in some scrubs are naturally anti-inflammatory and have no fragrance.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58783/how-do-i-choose-the-best-ceramic-ionic-hair-dryer/,"Using an ionic hair dryer can significantly improve the health of a user’s hair over time.  Instead of using heat like a traditional hair dryer, ionic hairdryers use ions, or negatively charged molecules, to evaporate moisture on hair follicles.  Choosing the best ceramic ionic hair dryer should be based upon several factors, including cost, quality, and the length of the manufacturer’s warranty.  

Buying a ceramic ionic hair dryer can involve quite a hefty monetary investment. Traditional hair dryers cost as little as half the amount that a consumer might realistically spend on an ceramic ionic hair dryer.  Brands vary in price depending upon the features offered.  Many hair stylists urge, however, that the price will balance out when you consider how long the ceramic ionic hair dryer will last in comparison with a cheaper, but lesser-quality model.   

Assuming an ionic hair dryer is within the customer’s budget, there are several ways of reducing the overall cost of purchasing a professional-grade hair dryer.  Online professional beauty supply companies and some beauty schools will sell ceramic ionic hair dryers to consumers for a fraction of the list cost.  Often, ionic hair dryer manufacturers will offer discounts during specified promotions.      

Not all ionic hair dryers are created equally.  Tourmaline ionic hair dryers offer the best ionic hair dryer experience on the market.  The ions created by the tourmaline mineral close the cuticle layer and break up the water particles twice as quickly as a standard hair dryer.  Ceramic ionic hair dryers work on a similar principle, but use less effective ion sources. 

Most ionic hair dryers come with a warranty, but not all of the warranties stand the test of time.  The best ionic hair dryers are guaranteed for at least a year.  Many are fully returnable for two years after the initial purchase date.  If purchasing online, be sure to read the fine print to see what the warranty entails.  In addition, many online sites will offer additional warranty protection for a fee.

One of the best ways to choose a ceramic ionic hair dryer is to read online reviews.  Customers who have experienced chronic problems with a particular product will be more than happy to share their experiences  Reading online reviews will help prospective customers identify negative trends within a particular product line. This allows them to make an educated consumer decision.", Beauty

How Do I Choose the Best Professional Microdermabrasion?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58778/how-do-i-choose-the-best-professional-microdermabrasion/,"The goal of professional microdermabrasion is to soften the skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  When selecting a professional microdermabrasion treatment, you’ll want to choose one that is abrasive enough to effectively exfoliate the skin but which won’t cause trauma. When performed in a spa or clinic, special machines are used that use an abrasive material to buff the skin, then vacuum the dead cells up. You’ll want to choose a professional who has been trained on the particular equipment, who has experience, and who can offer positive testimonials from satisfied clients.

Professional microdermabrasion is a treatment that uses revolving crystals to remove dead skin, which results in a smoother, fresher complexion. Treatments can also help reduce excess oil on the skin and clean out clogged pores and blackheads.  The professional you select should use a tool that uses clinically safe abrasive particles, such as aluminum oxide or sodium bicarbonate, that work by buffing and polishing the skin. Some more expensive tools use a wand with a diamond tip instead of a stream of abrasives.      

Most professional microdermabrasion machines have four primary functions. The machine should gently pull and raise the skin to be treated. This creates mild swelling, which helps to bring up any impurities. The abrasive materials then shoots across the skin, removing the impurities and dead skin cells, and the vacuum action of the machine then removes the debris from skin for disposal. For the best results, you should undergo at least three sessions of professional microdermabrasion. 

When choosing a spa or clinic for professional microdermabrasion, you’ll want to make sure that the staff member performing the procedure has been properly trained and has experience with the particular machine. Microdermabrasion that is performed incorrectly can cause permanent damage to the skin, so you’ll want to be confident that the technician knows what he or she is doing. It’s a good idea to talk to the technician who will be doing the procedure about his or her training and experience to get a sense of how familiar he or she is with the process. If you aren’t comfortable with the technician, don’t go through with the procedure.

A good way to get a sense of a technician’s or facility’s quality is to talk to people who have been treated there. Many reviews are available online, although it’s not always easy to tell if a review was written by an actual client. If you know someone who has undergone professional microdermabrasion, he or she may be happy to share information about the experience. You can also check with your local Better Business Bureau or other local business rating organization to see if there have been any complaints about a particular facility.

Scrubs and exfoliating creams are alternatives to professional microdermabrasion treatment. The best exfoliation products will often contain the same crystals that are found in professional treatment, but must be used manually instead of with the tool. You can simply rub the products on your face in a circular motion so the crystals remove the dead skin. Some manual exfoliation products also contain moisturizing ingredients that can help repair the skin after the exfoliation process.", Beauty
How do I Choose the Best Cocoa Body Butter?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58774/how-do-i-choose-the-best-cocoa-body-butter/,"You can decide on the best cocoa body butter for you by trying different options, paying close attention to your skin, and avoiding products that contain ingredients you may be sensitive to. There is no one specific product that works for everyone, because each person’s skin is different and responds better to different things. To discover what works best for you, begin by browsing online or visiting a local retailer. 

In many ways, cocoa body butter differs from traditional lotions. It is generally richer in texture, thicker, and contains cocoa butter as one of the main ingredients.  Cocoa butter is made from the rich yellow fat derived from cocoa beans, the same beans used in making chocolate. 

This body butter may also contain various other ingredients, often mixing Shea butter and additional skin smoothing agents to provide optimum softness to the skin. Begin looking for the cocoa body butter that fits you best by browsing through several options. Read the labels and find a variety that matches your skin type. If you have very dry skin, you may want an option with various additional oils and moisturizers to soften the dry patches.       

You should quickly notice how each body butter makes your skin look and feel. If you find that a particular brand or type leaves you feeling gritty or oily, switch to a different formula. When you’ve chosen one that works for you, your skin should begin to feel soft and supple without excess oils creating a problem. 

If at any time your skin becomes irritated, red, inflamed, itchy or bumpy, discontinue use of the product and contact your doctor. This could signal an allergic reaction. You should only try one cocoa body butter at a time so if a reaction does occur youare able to tell which product caused the problem. For very mild reactions, wash the affected area with mild soap and warm water. You can also apply a hydro-cortisone based cream to alleviate any itching.

Once you have chosen a cocoa body butter that seems to work the way you want, continue testing it for a week or two. If no adverse reactions occur and your skin becomes healthier and softer; it’s safe to say that you have found a good match. Otherwise, try a new variety. 

Make sure to buy the smallest tub available of each cocoa body butter while you are still testing them. You may even be able to find free or low cost sample-sized versions through the manufacturer or brand retailer. This will prevent you from wasting money on an item that you can’t use.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Natural Night Cream?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58775/how-do-i-choose-the-best-natural-night-cream/,"Dermatologists and consumers often agree that natural night cream formulas may be better for the skin than chemical-based ones. A natural night cream usually features an oil or vegetable butter base, which is infused with herbal extracts and essential oils that are known to heal the skin. They also usually omit the preservatives and chemicals that may harm skin over time. When you’re looking for a good natural night cream, it is important to understand what your skin needs. From there, you can choose which ingredients work best for you. 

Before you consider what ingredients should go into your natural night cream, you should take an assessment of your skin. Examine it to see whether it is oily and acne-prone, dry and flaky, features fine lines, or tends toward large pores. These factors will help determine what extracts and oils will nourish your skin best. For instance, if your skin is already oily, applying olive oil to your face might only exacerbate your problem. Write down all of your skin’s characteristics so you don’t forget any key factors when making your decision.       

The next choice to make for your natural night cream formula is what kind of base you will use. If you have dry skin, or aren’t particularly prone to blemishes, you might have success using coconut oil, lanolin oil, or vegetable butter as a base. Oily skin types and those who break out easily may want to opt for aloe vera gel because it is not greasy but still helps hydrate the skin. It is important to moisturize all skin types to keep them healthy and fresh-looking. 

After picking your base, you should typically decide what extracts and essential oils you want to include. Some ingredients — like rose water, rose hip oil, or vitamin E extract — may be included in natural night cream formulas for all skin types because they nourish the cells. For dry skin, choose among jojoba, lavender, sweet almond and geranium oils. You may use just a bit of each of these, or choose just one. Experimenting with different formulas is also acceptable, and even sometimes recommended. 

Oily or blemish-prone skin often benefits from natural night cream made with chamomile extract, a touch of mint or ginger oil, green tea powder, and some kind of citrus extract. Many with blemish-prone skin swear by grapefruit extract, though others prefer orange or lime.

When you’ve chosen all of your ingredients, it is time to combine them. This may be done in a microwave-safe bowl or double boiler. Simply heat and stir the ingredients together. Aloe vera gel should be melted over the lowest heat possible to keep it from evaporating. The finished night cream may be poured into an airtight plastic container for safekeeping.", Beauty
What is Organic Lipstick?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58776/what-is-organic-lipstick/,"Organic lipstick substitutes natural pigments, oils, and butters for many of the toxic ingredients found in traditional lip makeup.  Conventional lip pigments usually derive their hues from synthetic colors mixed in heavy waxes and preserved by parabens, which are chemicals that have been shown in medical studies to cause cancer in some animals.  Concern for health and the environment are two reasons that might be compelling the expansion of organic lipstick offerings around the world.  These environmentally-friendly lip stains have become part of an emerging green cosmetics trend. 

The color for organic lipstick comes from fruits and flowers. These pigments are typically mixed with coconut, castor, and palm oil. Solid moisturizers like cocoa butter and shea butter are often added to give the signature clay-like lipstick texture that can be molded into the tubular shape that is typical for lipsticks. These butters also help the color adhere to lips. 

Petrolatum, a staple of most mainstream lipsticks, is absent from organic varieties because some manufacturers are concerned about studies suggesting petroleum, the precursor of petrolatum, is toxic.  Ingredient lists for organic lipsticks also show the absence of chemical tar-based colors and aluminum, which research suggests has a possible link to Alzheimer’s disease.  Some consumers have been concerned that such toxins can leach from their lips into foods and drinks.      

Government tests showing an increasing presence of lead in lipsticks have resulted in many organic lipstick makers advertising that they are 100-percent lead free. Most organic lipsticks also advertise that they are gluten-free for those who have allergies. Soy-free is another common claim on organic lipsticks when manufacturers wish to address consumer concerns about the possible risk of brain ailments and thyroid problems linked to soy.  Most governments do not investigate the veracity of these claims. 

Flower blooms and berries yield a wide enough range of natural dyes that organic lipsticks generally do not result in a lack of lip color choices.  Most manufacturers typically offer groups of red, purple, brown and pink organic lipstick shades to closely rival selections in traditional lipsticks.  The lip colors generally have much more moisture than regular lipsticks due to the addition of natural oils and butters; however, this also means that color might fade faster and that organic lipstick will have to be reapplied throughout the day.  Lips lack their own source of moisture, however, so many people believe lips become healthier from the use of moisturizing, organic lipsticks. Infections and bacteria can enter through cracks in poorly moisturized lips.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Laser Epilator?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58777/how-do-i-choose-the-best-laser-epilator/,"Laser epilation, also called laser hair removal, uses light to damage the hair follicle, causing body hair to fall out at the root. This procedure was once available only from professional clinics, but hand-held consumer devices now allow you to remove hair at home. These devices are usually less expensive, less powerful, and less dangerous than commercial varieties, with some providing only temporary results. The best laser epilator brands use true lasers instead of pulsed light and have been approved by a government agency. Look for devices that advertise realistic results and which offer a warranty in case of product failure.

Intense light in the right frequency can heat up the dark hair follicle without damaging surrounding skin, causing the hair to fall out. This works best on people with dark hair and light skin and will not work at all on gray, blond, or white hair. Dark-skinned patients often experience reduced effectiveness or undesirable side effects. In most cases, multiple laser epilator treatments are required for permanent removal, since hair must be in the growth phase for effective treatment.      

Clinic-based laser hair removal first became publicly available in the 1990s, with home laser epilators appearing in the late 2000s. These devices use less power and a smaller treatment head than professional models, requiring longer treatment periods for effective hair removal. They often include extra safety features, such as skin tone sensors, which reduce the danger of burns, pigmentation irregularities, and other side effects associated with poor hair-skin contrast.

At-home epilation devices may use either intense pulsed light (IPL) technology or true lasers. An IPL-based laser epilator produces greater immediate results, but cannot remove hair permanently. Any hair removed will come back during the next growth cycle, so keep this in mind if considering this type. Devices with true lasers tend to cost more and require more careful treatment, but produce longer-lasting effects. Many advertise only permanent hair reduction, since they may leave a few stray hairs or lighter, slower-growing hair that can’t permanently be removed. 

Some laser epilators carry certification by a government health or medical body. These devices and the technology behind them have been tested for consumer use, but may not be approved for use on the face, genitals, or other sensitive parts of the body. Devices without a certification use unapproved technology and may not be as safe or effective.

Good laser epilator manufacturers advertise their products realistically, and will tell you if their devices don’t work with certain skin or hair types. Avoid products that don’t mention disadvantages or which do not offer a replacement plan in case of problems. Read all warranty and guarantee documentation carefully before purchasing, as the battery and light source in many laser epilator devices are good for only a certain number of pulses. The manufacturer may not replace devices that fail after this point.", Beauty
What Are the Different Types of Women’s Cologne?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58770/what-are-the-different-types-of-womens-cologne/,"Women’s cologne comes in three different varieties: eau de parfum, with a high concentration of fragrance, eau de toilette, with a lower concentration of fragrance and a lighter scent, and eau de cologne, a mix of fragrance and essential oils. Most varieties of women’s cologne fall into six distinct fragrance types: oriental is made from spices; floral is a combination of flowers; citrus comes from different citrus fruits; and green, from grass and plants. A blend of earthy aromas is known as Chypre, and Fougere comes from a combination of herbs and plants. The varieties come in spray bottles, fragrance towelettes, and concentrated roll-ons. 

Eau de parfum is popular because of the long-lasting fragrance it produces. It contains up to 15 percent concentrated fragrance blended with water, blending agents, and preservatives. Most bottles of eau de toilette contain six percent or less. This type of women’s cologne may not last as long as eau de parfum, but it produces a much lighter scent that some women prefer. Eau de cologne blends concentrated fragrances with other ingredients, such as citrus oil, to produce a slightly different scent. Women will recognize the primary fragrance as well as the fresh ingredients in this type of cologne. 

Most types of women’s cologne fall into a specific fragrance type, depending on the primary ingredients used to develop the fragrance. Oriental fragrances contain scent from spices, amber or resins and have a heavy, musky scent. Floral fragrances are produced by blending flowers, such as roses, jasmine, violets, or lilies. This sweet, feminine fragrance type is popular for women’s cologne. 

Citrus types have a light, fresh scent that comes from blending citrus fruits such as lemons, grapefruits, and limes. Green fragrances use a blend of trees, grasses, and plants, such as pine and juniper, to produce a natural and light scent. Blended herbs, such a patchouli, moss, and spices to create the sweet but earthy scents of Chypre fragrances. Many men’s colognes fall into the Fougere type, but some popular brands of women’s cologne are also included in this category, which is produced from a blend of fern plants with herbs, creating a simple, clean scent. 

Most manufacturers market the different types of women’s cologne as a spray, a towelette, and a roll-on. A spray has a spray pump that releases a mist of the fragrance, while towelettes are pre-moistened with the perfume. Roll-ons typically have a higher concentration of fragrance and are applied directly to the skin.", Beauty
What Are the Different Types of Braided Updos?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58771/what-are-the-different-types-of-braided-updos/,"Depending upon how they are executed, braided updos can add a touch of elegance or a bohemian flair to any look. Among the most popular polished braided updos are the braided bun and the tucked French braid. Those seeking casual, trendy braided updos may wish to try a half or full wreath style. 

Certain types of braided updos can produce a sleek, polished look appropriate for formal events. One such look is the braided bun. To execute this look, the hair is gathered at the nape of the neck, braided, coiled into a bun, and then secured in place with bobby pins. A modern variation on this simple style can be achieved by braiding one or more small sections of hair before executing a braided bun as normal. These small braided sections will be worked into the larger braid, adding visual interest to the style.       

The tucked French braid is another braided updo which can produce a sophisticated look. Achieving this look is generally fairly straightforward, and begins with the arrangement of the hair into a French braid. This is done by gathering a section of hair from the crown of the head and beginning to braid it as normal. Before crossing an outer strand of the braid over the center strand, a bit of loose hair is added to that strand until all hair has been incorporated into the braid. Finally, the ends of the hair are tucked beneath the braid at the nape of the neck, and held in place with bobby pins.

Those who would prefer laid-back, bohemian braided updos might wish to try a wreath style. This style has many possible variations, and is well suited to experimentation. Perhaps the most basic version of the wreath style involves parting the hair down the center and then arranging it in two braids. Both of these braids can then be wrapped around the bottom half of the head and pinned into place, forming a half wreath. Alternatively, one of the braids can be wound over the crown of the hair while one is wound around the bottom half of the head, resulting in a full wreath.  

Possible variations on the wreath style are limited only by one’s creativity and hairstyling abilities. Using the French braiding technique when creating a wreath style can produce a visually-pleasing look, for instance, as can weaving ribbons into one’s braids. Those who find it difficult to braid the sections of the hair that cannot easily be seen in the mirror might consider enlisting the help of a friend.", Beauty
How Do I Choose the Best Cheap Hair Dryer?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58772/how-do-i-choose-the-best-cheap-hair-dryer/,"A cheap hair dryer might not always be state of the art, but you might be able to find an inexpensive model with various features if you’re a smart shopper. If you prefer a ceramic, tourmaline, or ionic model at a cheap price, try an online auction or your neighborhood flea market. Discount department stores might have year-end clearances as well. When choosing a cheap hair dryer, however, you might want to consider a few factors such as wattage and energy-saving features. When choosing an inexpensive blow dryer, look for one with settings of low, medium, and high heat, and preferably a “cool shot” feature as well. 

Even a cheap hair dryer should offer a setting that is sometimes referred to as a “cool shot” or cool down mode. After drying your hair on medium to high heat, you’ll want to select the cool down button for setting your hair in place when styling. If your hair is very short, or you do not style it when blow drying, you might not need this optional feature.       

Keep in mind, if you’re buying a cheap hair dryer, it might not last very long. This is why obtaining a warranty for your hair dryer is essential. Also inquire about the return policy should your cheap hair dryer fail to operate correctly after a specified amount of time. If you’re choosing a budget-priced blow dryer, avoid unfamiliar brand names. Buy your hair dryer from a reliable name-brand manufacturer known for making electronic styling products. 

A cheap hair dryer with less than 2,000 watts of power might take a while to thoroughly dry your hair. An 1,800-watt model might be sufficient, however, if your hair is short to medium length. You might be able to find a model with higher wattage on sale, so check Sunday flyers and watch for television advertisements as well. 

Another feature to look for in an inexpensive hair dryer is lightweight portability. This is a good feature if you travel often, as you can take it along without adding a lot of bulk in your luggage. At the same time, if you tend to multi-task when you’re on the go, you will probably prefer a model that does not sound like a bulldozer when you power it on. Some of the cheaper models can be quite noisy, so read the package to ensure the blow dryer runs quietly.", Beauty
What is Frankincense Aromatherapy Oil?,http://erklart.com/beauty/58773/what-is-frankincense-aromatherapy-oil/,"Frankincense aromatherapy oil is an essential oil made from the resin of the boswellia tree. Known also as olibanum, frankincense aromatherapy oil is a thin, pale yellow-green liquid commonly used for spiritual and therapeutic purposes. The oil has a rich, complex aroma that is variously described as spicy, woody, earthy and balsamic. When used in the practice of aromatherapy, frankincense oil is believed to have a calming, grounding effect that relieves stress and quiets the mind. 

The genus Boswellia is a hardy tree native to northwestern India, southern Arabia, and eastern Africa. Four species of the Boswellia genus are used to produce frankincense aromatherapy oil: Boswellia sacra from Saudi Arabia; Boswellia frereana from Somalia; Boswellia carteri from eastern Africa, and Boswellia serrata from India. The word frankincense is derived from French words “franc”, meaning noble, pure, or real, and “encense”, meaning incense.       

Frankincense aromatherapy oil is produced by peeling away the bark of the boswellia tree and cutting an incision in the trunk. Over the course of several weeks, the milky sap flows from the incision and hardens into resinous drops called tears. The essential oil is then extracted from the resin through steam distillation. Frankincense is available in several grades of quality, depending on the soil and climate in which the boswellia trees grow, the season in which the resin is harvested and how close to the incision the resin tears have formed. Other factors include its purity, aroma, color, and age.

When used for therapeutic purposes, frankincense aromatherapy oil is commonly combined with unscented oils or lotions and massaged into the skin by a massage therapist. Frankincense aromatherapy oil may also be heated over a small flame in a fragrance diffuser, which releases the aroma of the frankincense into the air. Other aromatherapy techniques include the use of frankincense oil in perfumes, soaps, bath oils, and incense.

An aromatherapist chooses essential oils according to clients’ conditions and symptoms. Frankincense aromatherapy oil is used to calm the mind in clients who suffer from stress and anxiety. When applied through massage, frankincense aromatherapy oil may also be used to treat muscular aches and pain associated with arthritis and rheumatism.  Frankincense oil may also be diluted with neutral oils and applied topically to treat various skin conditions and in vaporizers to treat respiratory disorders. Frankincense is generally considered non-toxic; however, it is important to consult with a physician before ingesting, inhaling, or applying topically.", Beauty
